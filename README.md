TASK 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
Description:

This task involves building a simple rule-based chatbot that can simulate a conversation with users. The chatbot responds to inputs using predefined rules implemented via if-else conditions or pattern matching techniques. This approach does not rely on machine learning but focuses on detecting specific keywords or phrases in the user's query to return relevant responses.

Key Concepts:
Rule-based natural language processing
Use of if-else logic and regex matching
Understanding user intent via keyword recognition
Basic console I/O interaction

Use Case Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
User: "Hi"
Bot: "Hello! How can I help you today?"

TASK 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
Description:
This project implements an AI agent to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is designed for a human vs AI interaction, where the AI uses the Minimax algorithm (optionally with Alpha-Beta pruning) to always play optimally. This ensures the AI is unbeatable, reinforcing key principles of game theory and decision trees.

Key Concepts:
Minimax algorithm for turn-based strategy
Alpha-Beta pruning for optimization
Game trees and adversarial search
Console-based user interface for gameplay

Features:
Smart AI that never loses
Clean and interactive game board
Turn-based system for human vs AI

TASK 3: Image Captioning

Description:
This task combines computer vision and natural language processing to create an Image Captioning AI. The system extracts features from images using a pre-trained CNN model like VGG16 or ResNet, then feeds the features into an RNN (like LSTM) or a Transformer model to generate natural language descriptions.

Key Concepts:
Feature extraction using CNNs (VGG, ResNet)
Sequence generation using RNNs or Transformers
Encoder-Decoder architecture
Dataset usage (e.g., Flickr8k, MS-COCO)

Output Example:
Caption: "A group of people standing around a table with food."

TASK 4: Recommendation System

Description:
This project implements a recommendation system to suggest items to users based on their preferences. The system can use content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, or a hybrid approach to recommend movies, books, or products. It helps demonstrate how user behavior and similarity metrics can be leveraged for intelligent suggestions.

Key Concepts:
User-item matrix representation
Cosine similarity or Pearson correlation
Collaborative filtering (User-User, Item-Item)
Content-based filtering (TF-IDF, feature vectors)
Example Output:
User Input: Likes "Inception"
Recommendation: "Interstellar", "The Matrix", "Tenet"
